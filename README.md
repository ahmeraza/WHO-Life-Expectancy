# Life Expectancy at Birth
Males and Females dataset across different regions with the details of life expectancy over the past few decades. 

## Description

This report analyzes the World Health Organization (WHO) significant trend in global life expectancy and 
healthy life expectancy (HALE) over the past two decades. From 2000 to 2019, global life expectancy increased 
by over six years, rising from 66.8 to 73.1 years. HALE also improved by 9%, increasing from 58.1 to 63.5 years. 
This progress was largely driven by declining mortality rates rather than a reduction in years lived with 
disability. However, the data indicates that the increase in HALE (5.3 years) did not keep pace with the 
overall rise in life expectancy (6.4 years), suggesting that while people were living longer, the additional 
years were not necessarily lived in good health.

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted this progress, reversing about a decadeâ€™s worth of gains. 
By 2020, both life expectancy and HALE regressed to 2016 levels (72.5 and 62.8 years, respectively). 
By 2021, the decline continued, bringing both indicators back to 2012 levels (71.4 and 61.9 years, 
respectively). This sharp downturn underscores the profound impact of the pandemic on global health, 
highlighting the vulnerability of public health systems and the urgent need for policies that enhance 
resilience against future health crises.
